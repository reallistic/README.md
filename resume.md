**Founding Engineer -> Consultant** | [Sequel](https://www.sequel.me) | Aug 2015 - Present | San Francisco, CA

*Our v1 product, **Query**, allowed users to share data about themselves in a controlled way. As 1 of the founding engineers, my responsibilities led me to architect and help implement a React-Native app and Python api that allows users to create ACLâ€™s for their data. Our v2 product, **Sequel**, aims to promote a more meaningfull way of sharing ideas.*
