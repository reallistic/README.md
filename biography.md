## Biography
Hello, my name is Michael Chase. I'm originally from PG County, MD and currently work for Ancestry.com.
I was raised by a single mother and supported by a slew of different family members, but especially my grandmother. I went to a decent high school called Suitland. Now, I say it was decent because it had so many programs like: Visual and Performing Arts for dance, acting, and visual art. It also had vocational programs like: Information Technology, Networking, and Auto body. If that's not enough, it also had a cosmetology and barber program.
Now, Suitland isn't breaking any records in the [rankings][usnews_high_school_rankings], but it definitely had a great deal of impact on getting me to where I am.
While there, I enrolled in the Information Technology program where we learned some computer basics. At the same time, I was in the marching band, on the auditorium technical crew, and I had a short stint as a SGA publicist (or something like that). I would say a big takeaway for me is this:

> Getting involved in academic and non-academic activities can sometimes boost you to heights you otherwise wouldn't believe possible.

There are a great deal of stories I could delve into, but I want to be brief.
One day my guidance counselor called me down to her office. If I recall correctly, at this time I was taking a college prep course in which some of our homework included doing things like applying to colleges and applying for scholarships.
This guidance counselor sat me down and said: "Mike, there is a college tour being sponsored by the Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority. Usually there is a fee, but a free slot was available and I thought of you."
Now, one thing you should know about me is back in my Junior year I once told a teacher instead of going to college I wanted to go to a vocational school. So, this was definitely not something I particularly asked for. (To this day, that teacher tells her students about how I wanted to go to TESST college and accentuates the s')

I went on this college tour and applied to every school that was waiving the fee for in-person applications. One of those schools was Norfolk State University (NSU).
I seem to recall I got into all of those schools I applied to. But NSU stood apart. Mostly, because I later was able to obtain a full academic scholarship through a program called DNIMAS. More on that later.

Now everything in the early days wasn't all good. Before graduation high school my mom was in a comma for 2 months and the doctors didn't think she would make it. I lost my dad at the age of 12 to a cancerous brain tumor, and my cousin was murdered not too far from his doorstep.
One day, because I was trying to "prove myself," I had the misfortune of witnessing a murder.
Given the situations, friends, and [policing][war_on_drugs] surrounding me, I occasionally wondered how I ended up being successful instead of imprisoned or worse - especially since some of my friends did.

Fast forward back to NSU.
Norfolk State University and the DNIMAS program (pronounced da-knee-muss) gave me what I feel and felt was a once in a lifetime opportunity. I still have my scholarship award letter in a protective film stashed away - it means that much to me.
I wish I could tell people stories about how I almost flunked out or had to get my sh\*\* together to graduate, but unfortunately I don't have any of those stories. What I always knew (both then and now) is that whatever I put in I would get out.
There were days when I didn't study as much as I could or should have, and those days I failed (or barely passed) the test. There were days where I studied as much as I thought I *needed* to and I got a B. There were days where I was so in love with what I was learning that I barely studied at all and got an A. It really just depended on the day.
